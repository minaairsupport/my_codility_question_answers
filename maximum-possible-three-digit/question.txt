Write a function that, given 3-digit integer N and integer K, return the maximum 
possible 3-digit value that can be obtained by performing at most K increases 
by 1 of any digit in N.

Examples:
1. Given N=512 and K=10, the function should return 972. The result can 
   be obtained by increasing the first digit of N four times and the second digit six times.
2. Given N=191 and K=4, the function should return 591. The result can 
   be obtained by increasing the first digit of N four times.
3. Given N=285 and K=20, the function should return 999. The result can 
   be obtained by increasing the first digit of N seven times, the second digit once and the third digit four times.

Assumptions:
1. N is an integer within the range [100...999];
2. K is an integer within the range [0...30];
