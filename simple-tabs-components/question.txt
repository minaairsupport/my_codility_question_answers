Your task is to implement a simple tabs component in React

Requirements

Your component must return a div With a className Of tabs.
For each children element with the title property, the component should render a button with the className Of btn.

Clicking on a button should change the currently active tab by:
  - rendering a child element corresponding to it a div with a className of view;
  - disabling the button (HTML attribute) and chaning its className to btn-active;

Intially the first tab should be active (the first child rendered, and the first button disabled and with class btn-active).
Only one button should be active at any given moment.

Remember to make your component the default export.

Hints
   
    -Your solution will be evaluated based on its correctness; performance and coding style will not
